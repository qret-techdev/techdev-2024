# techdev-2024

GitHub for QRET's 2023 - 2024 Tech Dev Project!

This will be the platform to save and work off of all code, including both the processing and hardware components.

Each contributor will have their own branch, where they can work off of their projects. This allows everyone to have their own space while being able to check up on what others are up to.

Please reach out to Teighin Nordholt on Slack if you have any questions about using GitHub or how it works for our subteam!
